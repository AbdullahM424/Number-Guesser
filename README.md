# Number Guesser

## Overview
The **Number Guesser** is a simple interactive game where the player guesses a random number within a predefined range. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts like user input, random number generation, and conditional statements. It serves as an excellent example of how to combine logic and user interaction in coding.

## Features
- Randomly generates a number within a specified range.
- Provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
- Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
- Option to play multiple rounds of the game.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Runtime Environment:** Node.js (or can be run in the browser)

## Installation
To get started with the **Number Guesser** project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahM424/Number-Guesser.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Number-Guesser
   ```

3. If running in a Node.js environment, make sure Node.js is installed on your system.

## How to Play
1. Start the game by running the JavaScript file:
   ```bash
   node number-guesser.js
   ```
   (Replace `number-guesser.js` with the actual file name if different.)

2. The game will prompt you to guess a number within a specific range.

3. Enter your guess. The program will provide feedback:
   - "Too high! Try again."
   - "Too low! Try again."
   - "Correct!"

4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.

5. The program will display the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.

6. You can choose to play another round or exit the game.

## Customization
You can customize the game by:
- Changing the range of numbers (default is from 1 to 100).
- Modifying the feedback messages.
- Adding a leaderboard to track scores across sessions.

## Example
```text
Welcome to the Number Guesser!
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 50
Too low! Try again.
Guess a number: 75
Too high! Try again.
Guess a number: 62
Correct! You guessed it in 3 attempts.
Would you like to play again? (yes/no): no
Thank you for playing!
```
